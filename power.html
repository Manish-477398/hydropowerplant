        <h1>1.1 Introduction:</h1>
        <p>A thermal power plant is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power. Itis also termed as energy centre because it more accurately describes what the plants do,which is the conversion of other forms of energy like chemical energy, heat energy intoelectrical energy.Energy exists in various forms i.e. mechanical, thermal, electrical etc... One form ofenergy can be converted into other by the use of suitable arrangements. Out of all these formsof energy, electrical energy is preferred due to the following advantages:-
            
             
            Can be easily transported from one place to another.
            
             
            Losses in transport are minimum.
            
             
            Can be easily subdivided.
            
             
            Economical in use.
            
            Easily converted into other forms of energy.Power is primarily associated with mechanical work and electrical energy. Therefore, power can be defined as the rate of flow of energy and can state that a power plant is a unitfor production and delivery of a flow of mechanical and electrical energy. In common usages,a machine or assemblage of equipments that produce and delivers a flow of mechanical orelectrical energy is power plant.A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven.Water is heated, converted into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electricalgenerator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser andrecycled to where it was heated; this is known as Rankine Cycle. The greatest variation in thedesign of thermal power station is due to the different fossil fuel resources generally used toheat the water. Certain thermal power plants are also designed to produce heat energy forindustrial purposes district heating or desalination of water, in addition to generatingelectrical power. Globally, fossil fuelled thermal power plant produce a large part of man-made CO

             emission to the atmosphere, and efforts to reduce these are many, varied andwidespread.Commercial electric utility power stations are most usually constructed on a verylarge scale and designed for continuous operation. Electric power plants typically use three phase or individual phase electric generators to produce Alternating Current (AC) electric power at a frequency of 50Hz (hertz, which is an AC sine wave per second).

            <h1>1.2 Concept of Thermal Power Station</h1>
            <p>Thermal power plant converts energy rich fuel into electricity and heat. Possible fuelsinclude coal, natural gas, petroleum products, agricultural waste and domestic waste. Othersources of fuel include landfill gas and bio gases. In some plants renewal fuels such as biogasare co-fired with coal.</p>
